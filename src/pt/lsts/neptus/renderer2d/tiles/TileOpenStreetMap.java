    //TODO put copyright text to show in renderer "© OpenStreetMap contributors"
    
//    Requirements
//
//    Heavy use (e.g. distributing an app that uses tiles from openstreetmap.org) is forbidden without prior permission from the System Administrators. See below for alternatives.
//    Clearly display license attribution.
//    Do not actively or passively encourage copyright infringement.
//    Calls to /cgi-bin/export may only be triggered by direct end-user action. (For example: "click here to export".) The export call is an expensive (CPU+RAM) function to run and will frequently reject when server is under high load.
//    Technical Usage Requirements
//
//    Valid User-Agent identifying application. Faking another app's User-Agent WILL get you blocked.
//    If known, a valid HTTP Referer.
//    Do not send no-cache headers.
//    Cache Tile downloads locally according to HTTP Expiry Header, alternatively a minimum of 7 days.
//    Maximum of 2 download threads. (Unmodified web browsers' download thread limits are acceptable.)
//    Note: modern web browsers in standard configuration generally pass all the above technical requirements.
//    Bulk Downloading
//
//    Bulk downloading is strongly discouraged. Do not download tiles unnecessarily.
//    In particular, downloading significant areas of tiles at zoom levels 17 and higher for offline or later usage is forbidden without prior consultation with a System Administrator. These tiles are generally not available (cached) on the server in advance, and have to be rendered specifically for those requests, putting an unjustified burden on the available resources.
//    To avoid having your access blocked, please discuss your requirement with system administrators either via their wiki pages or on the IRC channel prior to starting.

//        MapQuest-hosted map tiles
//        You are free to use the MapQuest map tiles in their existing applications or in your applications so long as you do the following:
//        You must always add the following attribution (including the hyperlinks) to any data, images and MapQuest-hosted map tiles: "Data, imagery and map information provided by MapQuest, Open Street Map <http://www.openstreetmap.org/> and contributors, CC-BY-SA <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/> ."
//        Note: MapQuest is working on a proper/better MapQuest page that people can link to but MapQuest has no intention of forcing people to update work already done before that page is up.
//        Note: on http://developer.mapquest.com/web/products/open/map a different (and shorter) attribution code is posted:
//        Tiles Courtesy of <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/" target="_blank">MapQuest</a> <img src="http://developer.mapquest.com/content/osm/mq_logo.png">
//        Of course, only MapQuest is mentioned in it, and thus some separate OpenStreetMap credits are required.
//        Because this site uses open source mapping data, your use of the map tiles, data and images is subject to the licenses you see on the map tiles and your use must comply with this license. You cannot add a more restrictive license to the map tiles, data and images on the site or create derivative works with a more restrictive license.
//        If the application will get heavy usage (current defined as more than 4,000 tiles per second) please let MapQuest know in advance at open@mapquest.com. Please include the estimate of usage, so we can make sure that we can accommodate the load.
//        Before making an announcement (e.g., a press release, or something that is "all official-like") that relates to this site or the data, tiles or images on it, please contact MapQuest at open@mapquest.com with some notice because we'd like to hear about your efforts and if folks are going to get excited and hit the website, we'd like to have everything working at peak capacity.
//        All the information is provided "As-Is" and without any warranty of any kind. We are also under no obligation to provide any error corrections, updates, upgrades, bug fixes, etc. Since this is open source data, there will likely be errors and faults so please use at your own risk and if you see something that's not right, contribute to the Open Source Mapping community to correct it. Please also be aware that we have no obligation to provide support, although we may opt do so in our sole discretion if one of our developers gets the urge.
//        
//        Tile URLs
//        The tile URLs are very similar to regular OSM tiles, with only the front of the URL being different.
//        OpenStreetMap tile URL  http://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/8/126/87.png
//        MapQuest tile URL   http://otile1.mqcdn.com/tiles/1.0.0/osm/8/126/87.png
//        MapQuest Open Aerial tile URL   http://oatile1.mqcdn.com/naip/15/5240/12661.jpg
//        Just replace the "http://a.tile.openstreetmap.org" bit with "http://otile1.mqcdn.com/tiles/1.0.0/osm".
//        Note: MapQuest has 4 subdomains set up, otile1 to otile4, all pointing to the same CDN. Just like with OSM's a.tile to c.tile subdomains, these subdomains are provided to get around browser limitations on the number of simultaneous HTTP connections to each "host". Browser-based applications can thus request multiple tiles from multiple subdomains faster than from one subdomain.
