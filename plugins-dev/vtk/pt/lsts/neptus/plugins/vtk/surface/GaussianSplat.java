 * splat point into a volume with an elliptical, gaussian distribution
 * 
 * vtkGaussianSplatter is a filter that injects input points into a structured points (volume) datase. As each point is injected,
 * it "splats or distributes values to neaby voxels. Data is distributed using an elliptica, Gassian distribution function.
 * The distribution function is modified usainf scalar values (expands distribution) or normals (creates ellipsiodal distribution rather than spherical).
